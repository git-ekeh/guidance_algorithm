# guidance_algorithm

Used the TextRank algorithm to annotate summarization datasets with keywords that are used as guidance at training time. 
The keywords are input as a "guidance" feature, along with the "document" and "summary" feature. 

The TextRank algorithm can be found in this paper (2004) "TextRank: Bringing Order into Texts" - Rada Mihalcea, Paul Tarau
